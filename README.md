### It does the following:

- **Keyword Search:**  
  Identify potential backlink partners via SERP results on keywords or search terms.

- **Filter & Analyze opportunities:**
  Assess their relevance (filter out direct competitors).

- **Extract contact details:**  
  Extract contact details from shortlisted pages or domains.

- **Generate personalized outreach:**  
  Generate personalized outreach messages on email, Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook based on the Markdown of the targeted pages, with instructions on required anchor text or keywords.

**You can then integrate this output to any messaging platform or automation tool via Make, n8n, or to ingest it as key properties into your CRMs like Hubspot, Salesforce, or Attio.**
